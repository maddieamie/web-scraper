### Tests

**How do you run tests?**
I used pytest and pytest-asyncio to run tests on the browser, and also if the main functions were updating with a test link. 

**Any tests of note?**
test_example() checks to see if the correct types of paragraphs are matching their intended text content. I formatted it with Chromium and then exported it in Python. 

**Describe any tests that you did not complete, skipped, etc**
I skipped a direct test of the get_citations_needed_report() function because the text might change over time, so I didn't want to hard-code a list. I did run the functions in my main code and did not get any errors.
